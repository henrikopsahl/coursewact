    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[First of all I would advice them to have backup on all their data and files. 
      They should use a well known third-party application for their data, for example NodeJS for sanitizing html.
      They should check how many times the third party app is downloaded to know if its a trusted app.
      I would recommend using an authenticator like One login or google authenticator, because they will make the sites harder to crack. 
      They should use automatic user timeout to protect their users credentials. 
      They should advice their customers to use strong and a new password everytime they make a new one. 
      If its a client who can afford it, they should hire security experts, and have professionals to attack them regulary.
